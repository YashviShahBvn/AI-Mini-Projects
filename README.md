# AI-Mini-Projects
Welcome to my AI Mini Projects repository! 🚀 <br>
A collection of hands-on AI, machine learning, and data science projects built while learning and experimenting.
Less about theory, more about building.
Built mainly to document my learning journey, share reusable code, and keep a growing portfolio of projects that actually work.
